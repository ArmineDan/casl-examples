# CASL hello world

This is a basic example that allows to play around with [CASL](https://stalniy.github.io/casl/v4).

**Note**: this example uses CommonJS as `@casl/ability` currently doesn't support new `exports` field in package.json and codesandbox doesn't allow to change the version of nodejs (10.x only at the time of writing).

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
